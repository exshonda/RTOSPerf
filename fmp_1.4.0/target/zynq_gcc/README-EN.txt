Overview
--------

TOPPERS/FMP (http://www.toppers.jp/en/fmp-kernel.html) is an RTOS with 
support for multi-core processors. It is developed by the TOPPERS 
project (http://www.toppers.jp/en/index.html) and distributed as open 
source code through the TOPPERS license 
(http://www.toppers.jp/en/license.html).

FMP follows the "TOPPERS New Generation Kernels" specification 
(http://www.toppers.jp/documents.html). Contact me for an English 
translation of the specification. A good way to understand FMP's API 
is by looking at the sample program in the "fmp/sample" folder, or the 
header files in "fmp/kernel/". (Hint: it is based on the uITRON4.0 
interface).

The main characteristics of FMP are:

  - It supports SMP and AMP configurations (however, in the case of AMP
    all cores should be able to execute the same instruction set).

  - Kernel and applications are linked in a single binary without
    memory protection.

  - Tasks are assigned to processor cores during the design phase. This is
    done through a configuration file (.cfg) as shown in the sample program.

  - The kernel will not automatically migrate tasks (i.e., load balancing)
    during the execution of the system.

  - However, the API allows migrating a task to a different processor core
    at run time.

  - The execution of FMP can be traced and displayed graphically through
    the TLV tracelog visualizer (http://www.toppers.jp/tlv.html)

  - Several target boards supported (ARM Cortex-A9, NIOS2, SH2A, SH4A)

This guide provides a quickstart for running FMP on the ZYNQ-7000
(a XilinX FPGA that includes 2 ARM Cortex-A9 cores) using the Zedboard.
